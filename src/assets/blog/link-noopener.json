Well, do you know that it has a potential of crashing your site and even have your user robbed?</p>\n<p>Just kidding. I exaggerated a bit there. But seriously, this is a security issue that can be exploited. And it really affects performance, too.</p>\n<p>When you click a link with <code>target=\"_blank\"</code>, the link opens up in new tab. As usual, nothing much happens. But under the hood, <mark>some of the most important properties</mark> of your page's <code>window</code> object get passed to the <strong>page that is going to open</strong> in the <code>window.opener</code> property.</p>\n<p>One of these properties is the <code>location</code> prop.</p>\n<p>With the <code>window.opener</code> property, the new page can redirect the page from which it was opened to some other page. An e-banking site <code>icici.com</code> can be redirected to <code>1c1c1.com</code>, and the user will almost always miss this transition.
